# Sample Biometric Driver

>[!NOTE]
> This sample was archived in February 2024. Microsoft still supports the WBDI interface that is documented in this section, and vendors can continue to write and submit for certification drivers that use this interface. You can download the archived sample from [Windows 11, version 22H2 - May 2022 Driver Samples Update](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/releases/tag/win11-22h2).

As you read the biometric design guide, you should also review the [WudfBioUsbSample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/releases/tag/win11-22h2) sample. WudfBioUsbSample is a UMDF-based WBDI driver that ships in Windows 7 Beta through Windows 11, version 22H2 versions of the WDK.

WudfBioUsbSample is based on the [umdf\_fx2](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/3528ffbb369fa0611aefd14c97bdd6ac5ee50c41/usb/umdf_fx2) sample driver. For information specific to WudfBioUsbSample, see the [WudfBioUsbSample description](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/releases/tag/win11-22h2).

This documentation refers to WudfBioUsbSample to show some of the requirements of a WBDI driver.
